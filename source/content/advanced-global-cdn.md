## Features

- Full-page & asset caching

  Unlike most CDNs that only handle images and other static assets, full-page technology lets you cache entire pages and assets at the edge.
- Layer 3 & 4 DDoS protection & mitigation
- SOC 2 compliance
  - SOC 2 compliance provides third party assurance to our customers about the adequacy of Pantheon’s information security system. Our SOC 2 compliance covers the Security and Availability Trust Services Criteria.
- IP allowlisting & blocklisting
  - Blocklist - prevent users with specific IPs or in IP ranges from accessing your site.
  - Allowlist - only allow users with specific IPs or in IP ranges to access your site, blocking everyone else.
- Token authentication / JWT (JSON Web Token)

  Use the AGCDN Edge to generate JSON Web Tokens<Popover title="JSON Web Tokens" content="A JSON Web Tokens is an Internet standard for creating compact, encrypted JSON-based access tokens that assert some number of claims, such as 'logged in as admin'." /> to help build your custom API.
- Custom error & maintenance page rules
  - Ability to Create custom error pages (e.g. 404 and 503 errors) for a tailored end-user experience.
- Geolocation based edge control

  Take action on the edge based on the physical location of the user (eg. blocking or redirecting based on country) or send back location information to your application for more custom control.
- Device detection and edge control
- Persistent Uptime

  Adjusts the "serve stale content" setting to make content available from the edge even if the site is unavailable.
- Full CDN edge logs

  See every request to your website, whether or not the content was cached. Full CDN edge logs combine the server logs with logs from the edge to provide a complete picture of your traffic.
- Modify headers at the edge

  Change request and response headers before your application starts up to create, add, delete, or update parts of your request.
- Edge Redirects

  Reduce requests on your CMS by moving page redirects to the edge.
- Domain masking and reverse Proxy
  - Domain masking: run multiple Pantheon or non-Pantheon applications behind a single domain, using different URL paths
  - Reverse proxy: serve content from another service (eg. S3) seamlessly from your application.
- Enterprise blue/green support
  - Support for blue green CI/CD processes that enable continuous testing and deployment and/or always ready disasater recovery.

### Additional Features from WAF/IO

- Efficient image optimization (**IO**) at the edge
  
  With IO, images render quickly from the edge, offloading work from your servers and adding resilience to your site. Drupal Image Styles has a limitation resizing Animated GIF files, so we supports resizing Animated GIF; a useful advantage of edge IO over CMS IO.

- Layer 7/Enterprise DDoS protection & mitigation
- OWASP & WAF rules for Drupal/WordPress

  Support for Open Web Application Security Project (**OWASP**) WordPress and Drupal rules. Example: SQL injection, XSS, etc.

- Custom/Comprehensive WAF services

  Our Web Application Firewall (WAF) inspects each packet in excruciating detail to block malicious traffic and is fine-tuned for WordPress and Drupal.

- Advanced bot detection & mitigation (Available as an add-on)

  The following third-party plugins are supported:
  
  - Shape
  - DataDome
  - PerimeterX.

  The customer is responsible for purchasing, maintaining payment for, and supporting these plugins.
